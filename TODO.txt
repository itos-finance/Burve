Add a test for price transitivity.
- Add liquidity for one token and give amounts such that the numeraire is in one
token.
- Add liquidity without that token to force a new numeraire, but add equivalent
value. It should get about the same number of shares.
- We'll need to seed the pool pretty significantly first to ensure slippage on
that last n-1 deposit isn't a big deal.
- We can also test this with a lopsided pool and then multiple get price calls.

Fix the defaultEdge problem for addliq
and add a test that uses edge when possible and default edge otherwise.

Have the vertex lock when it is unable to withdraw from a vault. Add unlocking mechanism when we're sure there is no depeg.
Also add a manual locking mechanism. Only allow privileged swaps when locked. This allows the protocol to capture that LVR and give it as rewards to users.

Check why failures to swap due to unavailability is a 0,0 swap. It should just error.
